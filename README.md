**TwitterStream**
A basic android app that captures feeds from twitter stream API

**Key learnings**
This project was helpful in learning Fragments, Listview, Loaders and content providers on Android. 
However, more than the features, it was the code deisgn which I believe was the good part. Separating code into fragments and layers with Activities classes acting as controller.
Also explored about OAuth protocol whose mechanism I had used in earlier projects but the concept itself was not known to me.
